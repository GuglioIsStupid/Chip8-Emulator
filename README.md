## Why

I wanted to learn more about emulation and how it works, and I heard that the best place to start is with Chip-8. It's a simple virtual machine that was used to make games in the 70s and 80s. It's a good starting point because it's simple and has a lot of resources available online.

## Progress

It's close to being done, but theres still a few bugs that need to be fixed. (for example, collision detection isn't working properly)
